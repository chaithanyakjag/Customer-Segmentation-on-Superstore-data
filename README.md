# Customer-Segmentation-on-Superstore-data
Customer Segmentation on Superstore dataset
## Overview
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, profitability, and other key metrics using unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering). By grouping customers into distinct segments, the aim is to derive actionable insights that can drive marketing strategies, customer retention efforts, and revenue optimization.
## Clustering Methodology
We applied K-Means clustering to group customers into different clusters based on their behavior. The number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method and validated with the Silhouette Score. The features used for clustering were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure comparability.

## Key Insights
- **High-Value Customers (Cluster 0)** are the most profitable, and efforts should be made to retain them through loyalty programs or exclusive offers.
  
- **Frequent Buyers (Cluster 1)** have high purchase frequency but low profit margins, suggesting potential for upselling.
  
- **Moderate Buyers (Cluster 2)** offer a good balance between sales and profit and should be nurtured with loyalty strategies.
  
- **Discount-Driven Customers (Cluster 3)** represent a segment that requires a strategic shift to improve profitability, either by reducing discount dependence or re-engaging them with alternative promotions.

## Conclusion
The customer segmentation provided valuable insights into the business's customer base, revealing distinct groups with varying behaviors and profitability. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their strategies to maximize customer lifetime value and improve overall business performance.
